            The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City, colloquially
            &ldquo;the Met,&rdquo; is the largest art museum in the Americas.
            Its permanent collection contains over two million works, divided
            among 17 curatorial departments. The main building at 1000 Fifth
            Avenue, along the Museum Mile on the eastern edge of Central Park in
            Manhattan&rsquo;s Upper East Side, is by area one of the
            world&rsquo;s largest art museums.

            Founded in 1870 by a group of American citizens, the museum&rsquo;s
            mission was to bring art and art education to the American people.
            The Met&rsquo;s permanent collection consists of works of art from
            classical antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings, and sculptures
            from nearly all the European masters, and an extensive collection of
            American and modern art.
